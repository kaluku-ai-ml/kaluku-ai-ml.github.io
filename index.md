## Mission: Closing the Gap

Kaluku AI is a specialized R&D lab dedicated to the deployment of **Industrial-Grade Artificial Intelligence.** We do not build wrappers; we architect proprietary technical moats for environments where "good enough" is a failure.

Drawing on decades of experience in **Silicon Valley high-volume manufacturing**, **semiconductor design**, and **renewable energy systems**, we provide the technical rigor required to move AI from the laboratory to the production floor.

### Our Principles

* **Rigor Over Hype:** We focus on foundational technical moats—optimizing the $0.1\%$ that defines industrial yield.
* **Verification-First:** We prioritize the probability of detection ($P_D$) and the minimization of false alarms ($P_{FA}$) to ensure ROI in mission-critical systems.
* **Architectural Sovereignty:** We develop custom, high-dimensional CV and ML architectures tailored to specific industrial constraints.

### Core Verticals

#### **I. Semiconductor Manufacturing & Design**
Optimizing yield in advanced nodes requires more than standard computer vision. We apply attention-gated architectures and multi-modal sensing to solve systematic bottlenecks in 14nm fabrication and beyond.

#### **II. Energy & Smart Grids**
At the grid edge, reliability is paramount. We develop ML-driven predictive maintenance and signal processing models designed to operate in harsh, high-variability environments.
